# BitStuffing

Used to automate NRZI bit generation from original message. Also allows easy conversion from bit Strings in the form of "01000100" into ArrayList<Boolean> where true = 1 and false = 0. These arraylists are then used for the actual bit stuffing and then there is logic to convert them back into bit Strings.
